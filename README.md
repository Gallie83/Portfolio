# Welcome to my website! 👋

🌐 [Live Website](https://gallie83.github.io/Portfolio/)

The inspiration for this website came mainly from two places, [Firewatch](https://www.firewatchgame.com/) and my favorite place in Vancouver - English Bay.

## Parallax Effect

The website uses a parallax effect where each layer scrolls at different speeds, with the closer layers scrolling faster to add a sense of depth to the website. To achieve this I am using the [react-sprint](https://react-spring.dev/) library which has a built in [Parallax](https://react-spring.dev/docs/components/parallax) functionality.

## English Bay

While watching another beautiful sunset at english bay, something about the colors in the sky and the way the layers sat across the horizon made me think of the Firewatch website.

So I contacted an artist on Fiverr - [Ibrahim](https://www.fiverr.com/users/boimwoim/portfolio?roleIds=), who I felt could capture the style I was envisioning. After a couple tweaks and revisions we had the finished homepage image to be used on my homepage, with each element as it's own SVG layer to achieve the parallax effect.
